# Operation Spark Donation Page

It is a donation web-page for a non-profit coding school 'Operation Spark' in New Orleans.
The interface is very simple: the main page informs about the donation tiers and after choosing one, person
is redirected to the donation page. Person has an option to skip the main page and go straight to the donation page.
This web app uses Firebase for authentication, database and deployment.
Stripe api is used for a secure donation/transaction.
